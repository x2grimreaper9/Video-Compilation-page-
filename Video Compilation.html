        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, forms the backbone of web pages by
          defining their basic structure and layout. It uses a series of
          elements to display text, images, lists, tables, and other static
          content on a web page.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
          CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the visual
          presentation of HTML elements on a web page. It allows for customized
          styling, including colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing, making
          websites visually appealing. CSS also supports responsive design,
          ensuring web pages look good on all devices.

        <h2>JAVAScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to static
          web pages, enabling dynamic content updates, form validations,
          animations, and responsive behaviors based on user interactions and
          events.
